      <description>A matter of choice? I&amp;rsquo;m quite a fan of dashboards (you couldn&amp;rsquo;t tell right?). I think that they offer an interesting medium with a double potential: useful for actual work, especially quality control and exploratory analyses, but also for presentation purposes - a dashboard can become the actual final product of research. It is not surprising then that there are so many choices in terms of dashboard frameworks. Are they all inter-changeable though?</description>

      <description>All it takes is an ROI When one is dealing with MRI data (especially in the case of quantitative MRI), it is usually a good idea to check how the data are distributed. An example: you picked a myelin water fraction (MWF) map - it is reasonable to expect that the values will be higher in white matter than in grey matter. After this very first quality check, probably you may want to check how things change in different white matter structures.</description>
