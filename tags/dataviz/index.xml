      <description>This is the second part of the dashboard framework comparison. The first part is here.
In the previous episode&amp;hellip; Let&amp;rsquo;s pick up where we left off, shall we? Last time I sketched the idea of making the same dashboard with four different frameworks. We are halfway through: so far we&amp;rsquo;ve seen Streamlit and Dash. But there is more out there!
In this second part I will be showcasing Bokeh and HoloViz.</description>

      <description>This is the first part of the dashboard framework comparison. The second part is here.
A matter of choice? I&amp;rsquo;m quite a fan of dashboards (you couldn&amp;rsquo;t tell right?). I think that they offer an interesting medium with a double potential: useful for actual work, especially quality control and exploratory analyses, but also for presentation purposes - a dashboard can become the actual final product of research. It is not surprising then that there are so many choices in terms of dashboard frameworks.</description>

      <description>Beyond rows and columns If you think about a literature review or a meta-analysis, your expectation in terms of format probably reflects the following description: a PDF file containing a large table with the main details from the surveyed studies. This immediate association is the result of some sort of immutability in time of reviews, and more in general scientific papers. But there is no reason for papers to be conservative, static objects.</description>
