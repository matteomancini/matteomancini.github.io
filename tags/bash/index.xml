      <description>Esoteric connectomes Graphs are straightforward objects: you have a bunch of nodes, some of them are inter-connected by edges, and it all makes sense. It is in real-world networks that things become complicated: what&amp;rsquo;s a node? What&amp;rsquo;s an edge? When it comes to the brain, the answers to these questions depend on what scale one is targeting, and what tools has available. For whole-brain, structural connectivity, the usual approach is to use tractography, and then count how many streamlines there are between each pair of regions to weight the associated graph.</description>

      <description>Everything looks better with glass How can we give the deserved credit to white matter pathways in diffusion MRI? Easy: let&amp;rsquo;s throw away everything besides white matter. Jokes aside, tractography can already be a lot to digest, and sometimes we just need a rough reference to understand what we are looking at. If it is true that less is more, glass brains are a simple yet effective idea. In this post, I want to explore one way to make a smooth brain proposed by Thijs Dhollander: using the average from several brain masks, and then playing around with image operations to obtain a smooth and thin silhouette.</description>
