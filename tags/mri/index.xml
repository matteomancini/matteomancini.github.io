      <description>DICOM another file There are two kind of (neuroimaging) people in this world: those who like the NIFTI format, and those who lie. Jokes aside, it is quite common for many neuroimagers to deal with the endpoint of the acquisition pipeline, to the point that not everyone has dealt directly with what actually comes out of an MRI scanner, data in DICOM format. But at some point, that time comes: for one reason or another, dcm2niix does not give us everything we need, and we need to go back to the source.</description>

      <description>You can leave your brain on One of the first steps almost every neuroimaging pipeline has to do is skull-stripping, to free the brain from its cage and start doing registration, segmentation, *insert here any processing you are into* , the list is long. There are many tools to accomplish that, I personally use FreeSurfer and despite the associated time cost (FastSurfer may be a solution though) I am happy about it.</description>

      <title>Histogrammers: a dashboard to quickly check MRI data</title>

      <description>All it takes is an ROI When one is dealing with MRI data (especially in the case of quantitative MRI), it is usually a good idea to check how the data are distributed. An example: you picked a myelin water fraction (MWF) map - it is reasonable to expect that the values will be higher in white matter than in grey matter. After this very first quality check, probably you may want to check how things change in different white matter structures.</description>
