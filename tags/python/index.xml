      <title>Game of Dashboards: one brain, four frameworks [Part 1: Streamlit, Dash]</title>

      <description>A matter of choice? I&amp;rsquo;m quite a fan of dashboards (you couldn&amp;rsquo;t tell right?). I think that they offer an interesting medium with a double potential: useful for actual work, especially quality control and exploratory analyses, but also for presentation purposes - a dashboard can become the actual final product of research. It is not surprising then that there are so many choices in terms of dashboard frameworks. Are they all inter-changeable though?</description>

      <title>DieSitCom - A minimal Streamlit-based viewer for DICOM data</title>

      <description>DICOM another file There are two kind of (neuroimaging) people in this world: those who like the NIFTI format, and those who lie. Jokes aside, it is quite common for many neuroimagers to deal with the endpoint of the acquisition pipeline, to the point that not everyone has dealt directly with what actually comes out of an MRI scanner, data in DICOM format. But at some point, that time comes: for one reason or another, dcm2niix does not give us everything we need, and we need to go back to the source.</description>

      <title>Every bundle counts - A recipe for bundle-wise, myelin-weighted connectomes</title>

      <description>Esoteric connectomes Graphs are straightforward objects: you have a bunch of nodes, some of them are inter-connected by edges, and it all makes sense. It is in real-world networks that things become complicated: what&amp;rsquo;s a node? What&amp;rsquo;s an edge? When it comes to the brain, the answers to these questions depend on what scale one is targeting, and what tools has available. For whole-brain, structural connectivity, the usual approach is to use tractography, and then count how many streamlines there are between each pair of regions to weight the associated graph.</description>

      <title>Connect, Rotate, Zoom - Interactive brain networks</title>

      <description>If you don&amp;rsquo;t make it interactive, enjoy only half I spent already a few posts on the topic of making ordinary stuff interactive, and despite the chances of literally wooing people when they see the final results, I think the final result is not the biggest selling point of interactive visualization. I think that what really makes interactive visualization great is the fact that makes it easier to explore the data without having to minimize the Jupyter Notebook, opening the terminal, looking for the file, opening fsleyes, and, wait, what was that I wanted to look at?</description>

      <title>The skull-strip club: quick visual skull-stripping with FSL BET and Streamlit</title>

      <description>You can leave your brain on One of the first steps almost every neuroimaging pipeline has to do is skull-stripping, to free the brain from its cage and start doing registration, segmentation, *insert here any processing you are into* , the list is long. There are many tools to accomplish that, I personally use FreeSurfer and despite the associated time cost (FastSurfer may be a solution though) I am happy about it.</description>

      <title>Grind those brains! Diffusion MRI preprocessing with papermill</title>

      <description>Notebooks: you love them or you hate them Notebooks are an interesting beast: they have become extremely diverse and popular, everyone loves them, from declared non-programmers to enthusiastic pythonistas, from Kaggle fans to scientists. Well, that&amp;rsquo;s not exactly true: notebooks are actually one of those things that you end up loving them or strongly feeling against them - with indifference being very rare and usually due to not having interacted with them a lot.</description>

      <title>Histogrammers: a dashboard to quickly check MRI data</title>
      <link>https://neurosnippets.com/posts/mri-histogram/</link>

      <description>All it takes is an ROI When one is dealing with MRI data (especially in the case of quantitative MRI), it is usually a good idea to check how the data are distributed. An example: you picked a myelin water fraction (MWF) map - it is reasonable to expect that the values will be higher in white matter than in grey matter. After this very first quality check, probably you may want to check how things change in different white matter structures.</description>

      <title>Interactive treemaps for interactive reviews</title>

      <description>Beyond rows and columns If you think about a literature review or a meta-analysis, your expectation in terms of format probably reflects the following description: a PDF file containing a large table with the main details from the surveyed studies. This immediate association is the result of some sort of immutability in time of reviews, and more in general scientific papers. But there is no reason for papers to be conservative, static objects.</description>
