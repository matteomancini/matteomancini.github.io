      <description>A matter of choice? I&amp;rsquo;m quite a fan of dashboards (you couldn&amp;rsquo;t tell right?). I think that they offer an interesting medium with a double potential: useful for actual work, especially quality control and exploratory analyses, but also for presentation purposes - a dashboard can become the actual final product of research. It is not surprising then that there are so many choices in terms of dashboard frameworks. Are they all inter-changeable though?</description>

      <description>DICOM another file There are two kind of (neuroimaging) people in this world: those who like the NIFTI format, and those who lie. Jokes aside, it is quite common for many neuroimagers to deal with the endpoint of the acquisition pipeline, to the point that not everyone has dealt directly with what actually comes out of an MRI scanner, data in DICOM format. But at some point, that time comes: for one reason or another, dcm2niix does not give us everything we need, and we need to go back to the source.</description>

      <title>The skull-strip club: quick visual skull-stripping with FSL BET and Streamlit</title>

      <description>You can leave your brain on One of the first steps almost every neuroimaging pipeline has to do is skull-stripping, to free the brain from its cage and start doing registration, segmentation, *insert here any processing you are into* , the list is long. There are many tools to accomplish that, I personally use FreeSurfer and despite the associated time cost (FastSurfer may be a solution though) I am happy about it.</description>
