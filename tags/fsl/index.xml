      <description>You can leave your brain on One of the first steps almost every neuroimaging pipeline has to do is skull-stripping, to free the brain from its cage and start doing registration, segmentation, *insert here any processing you are into* , the list is long. There are many tools to accomplish that, I personally use FreeSurfer and despite the associated time cost (FastSurfer may be a solution though) I am happy about it.</description>

      <description>Notebooks: you love them or you hate them Notebooks are an interesting beast: they have become extremely diverse and popular, everyone loves them, from declared non-programmers to enthusiastic pythonistas, from Kaggle fans to scientists. Well, that&amp;rsquo;s not exactly true: notebooks are actually one of those things that you end up loving them or strongly feeling against them - with indifference being very rare and usually due to not having interacted with them a lot.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Use a container&amp;rdquo; is the new &amp;ldquo;You need a virtual machine&amp;rdquo; I have to be sincere: the first time I heard about containers I was not impressed. It sounded like an exotic approach, and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t see why would you need that. A few years later, I have changed my mind a lot about it: not only containers can be used to create reproducible workflows, but they are also useful in several applications (taken to the extreme in some cases).</description>
