      <description>A matter of choice? I&amp;rsquo;m quite a fan of dashboards (you couldn&amp;rsquo;t tell right?). I think that they offer an interesting medium with a double potential: useful for actual work, especially quality control and exploratory analyses, but also for presentation purposes - a dashboard can become the actual final product of research. It is not surprising then that there are so many choices in terms of dashboard frameworks. Are they all inter-changeable though?</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Use a container&amp;rdquo; is the new &amp;ldquo;You need a virtual machine&amp;rdquo; I have to be sincere: the first time I heard about containers I was not impressed. It sounded like an exotic approach, and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t see why would you need that. A few years later, I have changed my mind a lot about it: not only containers can be used to create reproducible workflows, but they are also useful in several applications (taken to the extreme in some cases).</description>
