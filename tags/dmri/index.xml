      <description>A day in the life of browsers A random thought crossed my mind last week: with Javascript at the top of programming languages rankings and with so many notebook systems covering most needs, how far are we from doing almost everything in a browser? Do we actually want to do everything in a browser?

      <description>Everything looks better with glass How can we give the deserved credit to white matter pathways in diffusion MRI? Easy: let&amp;rsquo;s throw away everything besides white matter. Jokes aside, tractography can already be a lot to digest, and sometimes we just need a rough reference to understand what we are looking at. If it is true that less is more, glass brains are a simple yet effective idea. In this post, I want to explore one way to make a smooth brain proposed by Thijs Dhollander: using the average from several brain masks, and then playing around with image operations to obtain a smooth and thin silhouette.</description>
