      <description>A day in the life of browsers A random thought crossed my mind last week: with Javascript at the top of programming languages rankings and with so many notebook systems covering most needs, how far are we from doing almost everything in a browser? Do we actually want to do everything in a browser? Postponing the dystopian consequences to the next Black Mirror season, it is true that browsers have become so universal that it makes sense to give access to resources through them.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Use a container&amp;rdquo; is the new &amp;ldquo;You need a virtual machine&amp;rdquo; I have to be sincere: the first time I heard about containers I was not impressed. It sounded like an exotic approach, and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t see why would you need that. A few years later, I have changed my mind a lot about it: not only containers can be used to create reproducible workflows, but they are also useful in several applications (taken to the extreme in some cases).</description>

      <description>Beyond rows and columns If you think about a literature review or a meta-analysis, your expectation in terms of format probably reflects the following description: a PDF file containing a large table with the main details from the surveyed studies. This immediate association is the result of some sort of immutability in time of reviews, and more in general scientific papers. But there is no reason for papers to be conservative, static objects.</description>

      <description>Everything looks better with glass How can we give the deserved credit to white matter pathways in diffusion MRI? Easy: let&amp;rsquo;s throw away everything besides white matter. Jokes aside, tractography can already be a lot to digest, and sometimes we just need a rough reference to understand what we are looking at. If it is true that less is more, glass brains are a simple yet effective idea. In this post, I want to explore one way to make a smooth brain proposed by Thijs Dhollander: using the average from several brain masks, and then playing around with image operations to obtain a smooth and thin silhouette.</description>
