      <description>Beyond rows and columns If you think about a literature review or a meta-analysis, your expectation in terms of format probably reflects the following description: a PDF file containing a large table with the main details from the surveyed studies. This immediate association is the result of some sort of immutability in time of reviews, and more in general scientific papers. But there is no reason for papers to be conservative, static objects.</description>

      <description>Everything looks better with glass How can we give the deserved credit to white matter pathways in diffusion MRI? Easy: let&amp;rsquo;s throw away everything besides white matter. Jokes aside, tractography can already be a lot to digest, and sometimes we just need a rough reference to understand what we are looking at. If it is true that less is more, glass brains are a simple yet effective idea. In this post, I want to explore one way to make a smooth brain proposed by Thijs Dhollander: using the average from several brain masks, and then playing around with image operations to obtain a smooth and thin silhouette.</description>

      <description>Biosketch I am on a quest for better maps of the brain. A biomedical engineer by training, I got my BSc from the University of Rome &amp;ldquo;Sapienza&amp;rdquo; in 2011, followed by a MSc from the University of Rome &amp;ldquo;Roma Tre&amp;rdquo; in 2013. My PhD has been focused on multimodal brain connectivity using a combination of MRI and non-invasive stimulation, collaborating with the Italian National Institute of Health, the Santa Lucia Foundation and the University of Sussex.</description>

      <description>Research vision: brain maps, cartograms and blueprints A constant element in my research are brain maps. What is a brain map? Is the result of some MRI acquisition? In a sense, even a simple clinical scan allows us to look at something hidden in our skull. However, the brain has such a complex structure, articulated in so many levels, that a map cannot be uniquely defined. Even the holy grail of hardcore connectomics, a full diagram of every synapsis, would still be missing elements: what about the myelin?</description>
